# project_SACA
Simple Address Checking Application
Only project.py and api.py are need to run the application.
The API-key contained in api.py is for the time being not valid, since I ran out of number of trials. So I will ask for a new one, 
and update it ASAP.
The Sample button uses the Sample_addresses.csv, which contains a sample of Swedish Addresses, mostly correct, but some are incorrect 
for trial purposes.
